        <h2>What We Do</h2>
        <p>
          Our movie app leverages open-source data from <strong>Finnkino</strong> (The Movie Database)  
          to bring users detailed movie insights and schedules for theaters. Built with a powerful tech stack—<strong>React</strong> for 
          the frontend, <strong>Node.js</strong> and <strong>Express</strong> for the backend, and <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> 
          for data storage—we ensure a smooth and efficient user experience.
